# Color Picking Game (Clone)
Web application game that centers around the user selecting the correct color out of a number of possible choices based on a randomly generated RGB value. The project is modeled after the Color Picking Game featured in Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course. I used this project as a test of my ability to make a web app with the same general aesthetics and functionality (as well as to improve my skills in working with vanilla JavaScript) without the use of the tutorial/guide. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Prerequisites
Nothing extra needs to be done from the user.
